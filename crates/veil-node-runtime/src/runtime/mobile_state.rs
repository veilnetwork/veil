//! decomposition PR3: mobile / battery-tier
//! state extracted into a dedicated [`Arc<MobileState>`].
//!
//! ## Why a dedicated struct
//!
//! Pre-PR3, `NodeRuntime` held five mobile-domain fields directly:
//! one live atomic flag (`mobile_background_mode`) and four
//! config-derived snapshots (battery scaling thresholds + scales).
//! These snapshots were ALSO mirrored on `NodeServices` and
//! `SessionRuntimeContext` — 15 field declarations across the three
//! structs, all kept manually in sync at builder time.
//!
//! Wrapping them in `Arc<MobileState>` collapses the three contexts'
//! field set to a single Arc each, and centralises the "snapshot-at-clone"
//! semantics that PR1 (`AnonymityState`) and PR2 (`MailboxState`)
//! established.
//!
//! ## What's in this bundle
//!
//! * `mobile_background_mode` — live AtomicBool toggled by mobile
//!   foreground/background hooks. Read on every keepalive tick.
//! * `battery_keepalive_scale_low` / `_medium` — multipliers applied
//!   to base keepalive when the device's battery level crosses
//!   thresholds. Snapshots from `cfg.session`; updated on `reload`
//!   via a fresh `Arc<MobileState>` swap (matches PR1 reload semantics).
//! * `battery_threshold_low` / `_medium` — tier-boundary battery
//!   percentages (e.g. low ≤ 20%, medium ≤ 50%). Same snapshot
//!   semantics as the scales.
